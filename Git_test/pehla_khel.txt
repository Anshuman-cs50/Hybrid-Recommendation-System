ha to kya special hai ye date me?

<FutureGD> Hey hey hey
Arnav, my friend how are you doing. Good to see you working with us on this project.

Today is special because it's the first day of our new project on GitHub. We're going to make a lot of fun things and working on our skills. I'm excited to see what we can do together.

Since today is the Hindu New Year day and the best day to start on our new project, I thought it would be a good idea to start our project today. So, let's get started and make this project a success. What do you say?

anything new?
